# What Is My Season - Color Analysis Quiz

## Introduction
Code Louisville Final Project where I have created a web application to help a person determine their 
season based on a series of questions formulated in a color analysis quiz. Once submitted, an alert occurs and tells a person whether they are a Winter, Summer, Spring or Summer. By adding your name, it uses your name when telling you your season.

## Technologies
The languages that I used are:
* HTML 
* CSS
* JavaScript

Created a hamburger menu in nav bar
